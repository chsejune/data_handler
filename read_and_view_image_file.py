# tested in python 3.5

# two ways of reading and opening image data (some image conversion methods included)
# one more reading image data method is added. (using scikit-image

# first way is to use opencv
# opencv reads and views the RGB image in BGR order.


# importing libraries
import cv2 # in color image, BGR is used as default
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # in color image RGB is used as default
import skimage as ski # in color image RGB is used as default
import skimage.io as skio # scikit-image read and view image

# sample data path
data_path = "data_sample/images/000001.jpg"

img = cv2.imread(data_path)  #image is read in BGR

# 이미지가 흑백 또는 컬러 인지 지정한 후 읽어드리는 방법
img = cv2.imread(data_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
img = cv2.imread(data_path, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

###  read an image cv2 설명 ###
# cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default flag.
# cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
# cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel
# Note Instead of these three flags, you can simply pass integers 1, 0 or -1 respectively.


cv2.namedWindow("", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL) # makes the window resizable, if it is commented the image viewer window will not be resizable
cv2.imshow("", img) # it shows image in BGR so the image is properly viewed
cv2.waitKey() # holds the window

# to convert the BGR image to RGB.
img_converted = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
cv2.imshow("", img_converted) # cv2.imshow is a BGR viewer so the converted RGB image will be viewed odd
cv2.waitKey()

# now to view image, need to use RGB viewer like as matplotlib's plt.imshow()
plt.imshow(img_converted)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# second way is to use matplotlib for read image and view image

img_rgb = plt.imread(data_path) # RGB image reader (for datatype: read png image as float32, others reads as uint8)

plt.imshow(img_rgb) # RGB image viewer


# third way is to use scikit-image for read image and view image

# read image
img_ski = skio.imread(data_path, as_grey=False) # if parameter "as_grey" is true, color image will be convert into greyscale image

# view image
skio.imshow(img_ski)


# convert image data types
# Data type	  Range
# uint8	      0 to 255
# uint16	  0 to 65535
# uint32	  0 to 232
# float	     -1 to 1 or 0 to 1
# int8	     -128 to 127
# int16	     -32768 to 32767
# int32	     -231 to 231 - 1

# use skimage for converting image data types

# from uint8 to float (vise versa)
img = plt.imread(data_path)
imgf = ski.img_as_float(img) # img_as_float: Convert to 64-bit floating point.
img8 = ski.img_as_ubyte(imgf) # img_as_ubyte: Convert to 8-bit uint.


# 이미지를 0~1 사이 float 값으로 표현하고 싶을때 간단히 255 로 나눠주면 된다.
img = plt.imread(data_path)/255.





## I think it is not working properly ##
## cv2 color value range setting
# 0 to 255 for CV_8S images
# 0 to 65535 for CV_16S images
# 0 to 1 for CV_32F images

# img8 = cv2.cvtColor(img_rgb, cv2.CV_8S)
# img16 = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.cvtColor(img_rgb, cv2.CV_16S), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
# img_32f = cv2.cvtColor(img_converted, cv2.CV_32SC4)
